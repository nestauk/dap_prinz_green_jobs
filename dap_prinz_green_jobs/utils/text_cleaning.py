    Splits a word written in camel-case into separate sentences. This fixes a case

    For example, the string "skillsBe" will be converted to "skills. Be"
    Some camelcases are allowed though - these are found and replaced. e.g. JavaScript
    Note that the present solution doesn't catch all such cases (e.g. "UKSkills")
