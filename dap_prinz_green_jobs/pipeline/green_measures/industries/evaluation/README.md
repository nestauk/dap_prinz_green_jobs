# ü§î Evaluation

## generate industries evaluation sample

To generate an evalaution sample of 200 job ads per SIC mapping method (closest distance, majority SIC, companies house), run the following:

```
python dap_prinz_green_jobs/pipeline/evaluation/industries_evaluation_sample.py
```

This directory contains a notebook that evaluates the **overall SICMapper**. The notebook is split into the following sections:

**Null analysis:** On the full dataset of extracted industries measures, what proportion are null? This includes null analysis of SIC codes in addition to industries measures.

**Threshold analysis:** On the full dataset of extracted industries measures, what is the optimal threshold for the two SIC mapping approaches? This includes a thresholding analysis of the `closest SIC` and `majority SIC` approaches to better understand completeness.

**Labelled Evaluation:** This section is split into two subsections:

- one that explores the effect of different thresholds on accuracy.
- one that explores overall accuracy.

If you would like to learn more about the evaluation results of the **company description classifier**, refer to [üì† 20230825 model metrics](https://github.com/nestauk/ojd_daps_language_models/tree/dev/ojd_daps_language_models/pipeline/train_model/company_descriptions#-20230825-model-metrics) in the OJD DAPs language models repo.

## üåä Thresholding analysis

The base thresholds for the two SIC mapping approaches (as defined in `IndustryMeasures`) are as follows:

1. `closest SIC`: **0.5**
2. `majority SIC`: **0.3**

The results are as follows:

for the `closest SIC` approach:

| Threshold | Accuracy | Number of Job Ads | % of Job Ads |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 0.5       | 0.785    | 200               | 100          |
| 0.55      | 0.811    | 122               | 61           |
| 0.6       | 0.87     | 55                | 28           |
| 0.65      | 1        | 8                 | 4            |

for the `majority SIC` approach:

| Threshold | Accuracy | Number of Job Ads | % of Job Ads |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 0.3       | 0.61     | 135               | 100          |
| 0.35      | 0.62     | 77                | 57           |
| 0.4       | 0.55     | 22                | 16           |

## üñäÔ∏è Overall Evaluation

Based on the thresholding analysis, we decided to use the following thresholds for the two SIC mapping approaches:

1. `closest SIC`: **0.5**
2. `majority SIC`: **0.3**

- 400 job ads were labelled by hand as being bad, ok or good SIC matches
- 65 job ads matched via companies house were labelled
- 200 job ads matched via closest distance were labelled
- 135 job ads matched via majority SIC were labelled

- the average company description quality is 2.75/3
- the average overall match quality is 2.15/3
- the average company house match quality is 2.1/3
- the average closest distance match quality is 2.33/3
- the average majority SIC match quality is 2.05/3

The results are as follows:

### Qualitative observations

üëç The SICMapper appears to **do well** when:

1. When the company description is explicit about the industry (i.e. "We are a manufacturing company")
2. When the company description contains multiple sentences that are explicit. (i.e. "We are a manufacturing company. We manufacture cars, bikes and planes.")

üëé It **does less well** when:

1. The company name (although not labelled a "recruiter consultancy") is actually a recruiter consultancy. (i.e. the Guardian)
2. When a term has multiple meanings (i.e. "Juice is recruiting for a manufacturing company" was mapped to a food related SIC code)
3. When a company description is vague (i.e. "We are a company committed to the future.")
