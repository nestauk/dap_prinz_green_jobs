# ü§î Evaluation

This directory contains the evaluation of the **overall SOCMapper**.

To get the evaluation sample we looked at the most common job titles given in all of the OJO dataset, and a random sample of job titles. These datasets can be created by running:

```
python dap_prinz_green_jobs/pipeline/green_measures/occupations/evaluation/socmapper_evaluation_sample.py
```

which will create `soc_evaluation_sample.csv` and `soc_evaluation_random_sample.csv`.

These datasets were manually labelled with how well we thought the job title was matched to a SOC code. We chose 3 categories - excellent, good or poor.

## üñäÔ∏è Overall Evaluation

This analysis can be run from the notebook `socmapper_evaluation.ipynb`.

### From a **random sample** of 200 job titles:

- 59.6% had a SOC 6-digit code matched
- 5% were only able to have a SOC 4-digit code matched
- 35.5% had no SOC matched

Using 118 job titles of the random sample with SOC 6-digit codes found:

- 66% had excellent quality SOC matches
- 23% had good quality SOC matches
- 11% had poor quality SOC matches

From the 5% (10 job titles) of the random sample with SOC 4-digit codes found:

- 80% had excellent quality SOC matches
- 10% had good quality SOC matches
- 10% had poor quality SOC matches

### We also labelled 300 of the **most commonly occuring** job titles in our dataset with quality measures.

- 89% had a SOC 6-digit code matched
- 4% were only able to have a SOC 4-digit code matched
- 7% had no SOC matched

Using 255 job titles of the most commonly occuring job titles with SOC 6-digit codes found:

- 82% had excellent quality SOC matches
- 10% had good quality SOC matches
- 8% had poor quality SOC matches

From the 20 job titles of the most commonly occuring job titles with SOC 4-digit codes found:

- 95% had excellent quality SOC matches
- 5% had good quality SOC matches

We note that the results from the most commonly occuring job titles are probably better since the job title tends to be more clean and standardised.

### Observations

A random sample of the job titles that don't match to a SOC revealed that extra cleaning may help them match to SOC codes. Some of the job titles that didn't match include:

['Disability Assessor Homebase / Front Office', 'Clinical Fellow ST3 Stroke medicine', 'IT Engineer - &#163;25-&#163;30k - Normanton / Hybrid', 'Entry Level Graduate Scheme', 'Operatives Needed', 'Waiting Staff 1', 'Staff Nurse, General Surgery - Band 5', 'PHP Developer Laravel Vue.js', 'Bike Courier parttime Liverpool', 'E&amp;I Technician Days', '1-1 Tutor Required - Wakefield', 'Flexcube Analyst permanent', 'Infection Prevention Control Nurse - Band 8a', 'Blinds and Curtains Installer', 'Senior Community Host - Woking', 'Data Architect, Microsoft Stack, Remote', 'Factory Cleaning Operative - &#163;1000 sign on bonus!', 'Retail Customer Service CSM 30hrs - Multi-site', 'Retail Customer Service CSA 30hrs', 'Driver weekend Liverpool']

## Future work

It'd be good to compare our SOCmapper performance to other mappers out there, for example [this python package that maps to 3-digit SOC](https://github.com/aeturrell/occupationcoder) or [the online tool from Cascot](https://cascotweb.warwick.ac.uk/#/classification/soc2020).
