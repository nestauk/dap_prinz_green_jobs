# ü§î Evaluation

## generate skills evaluation sample

To generate an evaluation sample for extracted and mapped skills and green skills, run the following:

```
python dap_prinz_green_jobs/pipeline/evaluation/skills_evaluation_sample.py
```

This directory contains a notebook that evaluates the overall **SkillMeasures** class. If you would like to learn more about the evaluation results of the green skill classifier, please refer to the Green skills classifier section of the [skills README](https://github.com/nestauk/dap_prinz_green_jobs/tree/dev/dap_prinz_green_jobs/pipeline/green_measures/skills#green-skills-classifier).

## üñäÔ∏è Overall Evaluation

**514** skills from **500** job ads were labelled for:

- extracted skill quality (1-bad, 2-ok and 3-excellent)
- mapped green esco skill quality (0-extracted skill too poor to label, 1-bad, 2-ok and 3-excellent)
- mapped all esco skill quality (0-extracted skill too poor to label, 1-bad, 2-ok and 3-excellent)

Overall, in the labelled dataset of skills:

there were...

- **494** unique extracted skills
- **309** unique mapped all ESCO skills
- **182** unique green ESCO skills
- **1** skill labelled as 0 (skill entity too bad to score) for green esco matches
- **3** skills labelled as 0 (skill entity too bad to score) for all esco matches

The distribution of labels are as follows:

### Qualitative observations

üëç The SkillMeasures appears to **do well** when:

1. It is matched to a **green ESCO** skill as opposed to any ESCO skill.
2. The entity has **more** context i.e. write sustainability reports vs. sustainability reports.

üëé It **does less well** when:

1. The extracted entity is poor (although this isn't always the case!)
2. The entity has **less** context i.e. sustainability reports vs. write sustainability reports.
